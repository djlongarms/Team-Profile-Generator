# Team-Profile-Generator

This application allows a user to input employees for their company. It asks the user for the employees role(Manager, Engineer, or Intern), as well as their name, work id, and email address. Additionally, it will ask a specific question depending on their given tole (Office Number, Github Username, and School Name respectively). Every time an employee is finished being put in, the program will ask if there is another employee they want to input.

Once the user is finished putting all their employees in, the program will automatically create and format an html file with their employees listed out on the page.

Here is an example result of running the code: [!Team-Profile-Generator Example Result](./imgs/Team-Profile-Generator-Example-Result.png)
